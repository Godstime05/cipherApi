## Introduction

CipherAPI is a project designed to provide a secure and simple way to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data through a web API. It utilizes encryption algorithms to ensure data privacy during transmission and storage.

## Features

### Encryption

- Provides a RESTful endpoint to encrypt data using strong encryption algorithms.
- Ensures that sensitive data remains secure by using industry-standard encryption techniques.

### Decryption

- Offers a RESTful endpoint to decrypt data that was previously encrypted using this API.
- Maintains data integrity and confidentiality while allowing authorized users to retrieve original data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Spring Boot
- Maven or Gradle (depending on your project setup)
- A code editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Godstime05/cipherApi.git
   cd cipherApi


Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install

Run the application:
mvn spring-boot:run

The CipherAPI should now be running and accessible through http://localhost:8080.

Usage
To encrypt data, make a POST request to the /encrypt endpoint with your data in the request body. To decrypt, make a POST request to the /decrypt endpoint with the encrypted data in the request body.
